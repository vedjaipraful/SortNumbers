# SortNumbers
The main() will take user input per line. If a non-number is entered, user input will be stopped further. The numbers collected until then will be sorted in descending order and printed to the console.

A few methods have been put in the main class - <br>
```isNumber()``` - to check if the input line is a number of a non-number <br>
```printArray()``` - print the array elements <br>
```sortArray()``` - sort the input array and update the same <br>
